## Redux - Additional Topics

##### What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount ) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app

##### When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
You export the function that points to another function that contains the dispatch and async function

## Vocab

> middleware
* Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.

> thunk
* Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action.
