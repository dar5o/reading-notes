>what is a loop?
+ Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.A loop can be explained as so: a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take x steps in one direction, then y steps in another.

>> ## For example 
 for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

> The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
+ for statement
+ do...while statement
+ while statement
+ labeled statement
+ break statement
+ continue statement
+ for...in statement
+ for...of statement

> *A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. Same with the do...while statement.*
>> However a while statemnt executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
>>> ## For Example
while (condition)
  statement
