> Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

To make a function we are going to need a couple things
+ first being the name of the function
+ a list of paramaters to the function, enclosed in a parantheses and separated by commas
+ the javascript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets

>>function square(number) {
>>  return number * number;

> ##The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

>> ##for example
>>> imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:
>>>>if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
