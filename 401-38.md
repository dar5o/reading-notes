## Redux - Asynchronous Actions

##### How granular should your reducers be?
As granular as they should be. It depends on the app and what it is doing

##### Pro or Con - multipule reducers can "fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
Pro. It is good to have multiple states in different components but reducers can listen to multiple-named actions so it is possible that you are unintentionally firing them

##### Name a strategy for preventing the above
combineReducer or better action names

## Vocab

> store
* holds the whole state tree of your application

> combined reducers
* a fuunction that combines reducers for use
