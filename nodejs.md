> Intro to node js

node.js is a google v8 javascript engine that uses non-blocking asynchronouse runtime to execute code. 

the engine is essentially the brain that runs google chrome and chromium type browsers built for performance.

a runtime javascript is a program/file that can execute javascript code on your computer.

npm stands for node packet manager

my computer is running node14.17.3

my computer is running npm6.14.13

if you want to install jshint you would type npm install -g jshint.

node is used for running js code outside of the browser.

pair programming is when a driver and navigator tackle some code. the driver types and the navigator says what to type.
