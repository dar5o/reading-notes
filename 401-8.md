## Access Control (ACL)

##### When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
Basic authorization is used when signing into a profile and retrieving data. Bearer authorization is used when you want to verify that the user that is trying to retrieve data is allowed to.

##### What does the JSON Web Token package do?
The JSON Web Token package allows you to use token authentication in your code.

##### What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
Make sure it is a "SECRET" and it is unique to the code.
