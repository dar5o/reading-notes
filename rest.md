roy fielding was one of many principal authors of the HTTP specification.

techniques we use today were used to talk to a small group of machines rather than all of the machines.

the https protocal that fielding and his friends created is a way of interacting with another machine. 
ex: GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE.

- GET
  + request data that already exists
- PUT
  + update data that already exists
- PATCH
  + partial update of data that already exists
- POST
  + send new data to be added
