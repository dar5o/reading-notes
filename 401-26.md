## COMPONENT BASED UI

##### Name 5 JS UI Frameworks
AngularJS, VueJS, EmberJS, NodeJS, OpenUI5

##### What's the difference between a framework and a library?
A library performs specific, well-defined operations. A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application
