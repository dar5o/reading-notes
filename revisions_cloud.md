>what is git?
 + git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.git mostly relies on local operations, most necessary information can be found in local resources. this allows for process expediency because a projectâ€™s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
