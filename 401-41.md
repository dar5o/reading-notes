## React Native

##### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
The Redux toolkit simplifies redux use cases while Redux 'Ducks' bundles reducers together into one file

##### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code

## Vocab

> redux toolkit slices
* a function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state

> namespace
* a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified
