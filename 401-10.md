## Stacks and Queues

> Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
- Stacks are data structures that allow us to insert and remove items. They operate like a stack of papers or books on our desk - we add new things to the top of the stack to make the stack bigger, and remove items from the top as well to make the stack smaller. This makes stacks a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure – the data we have put in last is what we will get out first.

> Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
- A queue is a data structure where we add elements at the back and remove elements from the front. In that way a queue is like “waiting in line”: the first one to be added to the queue will be the first one to be removed from the queue. This is also called a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure. 

Queues are common in many applications. For example, when we read a book from a file as in Assignment 2, it would be natural to store the words in a queue so that when we are finished reading the file the words are in the order they appear in the book.
For a stack: a helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.

> Principles

##### FIFO: The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.
##### LIFO: The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack.
#### or 
##### FILO: The First object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.
##### LILO: The last object or item in a queue is the last object or item to leave the queue.
