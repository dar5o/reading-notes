# Lecture Notes
## Inline Style and Script
- the old way of inserting styling and script directly into our HTML
- we now sepperate this code "sepperation of concerns"
  + to make code bases more organized and easier to read
  + easier to debug
  + easier for teams to all work on one application at once
- to add code for script and styling inline
  + for styling add a ` style ` attribute directly to and element:
  + `<h1 style="color: green"> Welcome Class</h1>`
  + to add script insert it in between opening and closing `script` tags
  + `<script> console.log('Hey Class!!!'); </script>`

  ## internal styles
  - these are styles added to the head of your html document within a style element
  - set rules for the entire document
  - `<style> body {background-color: darkgoldenrod;} li {color: red;}</style>`
