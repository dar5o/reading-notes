>what is html?
html stands for hypertext markup language and it is used as the foundation for every website. essentially, it is the content of your webpage

HTML consists of elements and tags, which you enclose, wrap, and title. For example if you wanted your website to have a sentence saying 
'the cat is very cool' 
you would write 
<img src= "C:\Users\dario\Downloads\download.png" alt ="<p>the cat is very cool</p>">
