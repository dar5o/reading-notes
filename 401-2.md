# Reading notes for class 2 of 401

## Express

The difference between a put or a patch is:
- put places an object somewhere
- patch updates the object

Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server:
- nock
- mocky.io
- mockserver

Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
- Swagger is a cloud-based API testing and documentation tool. It seems to have more attraction based on functionality and popularity, while ApiDoc creates a documentation from API annotations in the source code. 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 409, 500, and 503.

Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST:
- Simple Object Access Protocol is a standards based web serveice access protocol that was develope by Microsoft in 2007. But it first appeared initially as XML-RPC in 1998, over 20 years ago. it works well in distributed enterprise environments, uses XML for all messages, and has become standardized. Representational State Transfer is another standard made in response to SOAP's flaws. REST will not work without the use of HTTP, it works very fast and efficiently because of this, easy to learn.
