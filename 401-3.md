# Reading notes for class 3 of 401

## Express REST API

##### Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

- printing a message
- timestamping
- validating and logging data

##### True or false: The route handler is middleware?

False. 

##### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

Don’t call next() in the middleware, instead use res.end, res.send, res.render.

##### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

Between the HTTP method being used and the path it is going to.

##### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

Callback being called twice, or another function trying to set a status code.

## Vocab

> Middleware 
  * Functions that access two applications

> Request Object
  * The main entry point for an HTTP Request, has properties for the query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers...

> Response Object 
  * HTTP response that an application sends back after recieving a request

> Application Middleware
  * Middleware that sends requests to the server

> Routing Middleware
  * Same as application middleware except it is bound to an instance of express.Router();

> Test Driven Development
  * Validates code before software is fully developed

> Behavioral Testing
  * Testing of outputs regardless of how the software actually arrives to it
