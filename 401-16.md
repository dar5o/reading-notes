# Reading notes for class 16 of 401

## AWS: Cloud Servers

##### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
1. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL
2. Request hits the router and the router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request
3. The action receieves the request and passes it back to the client
4. Server renders the page as HTML and the controller responds with the HTML back to the browser which the client can see

##### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
A machine that waits for requests and runs functions to respond with

##### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Upload your code and content publicly to then have it hosted online rather than locally
