adding images is as easy as using the `<img>` element. however there are a couple attributes that can help you modify how your image looks on the website. you can use width and height in css to control the max height and max width for an image. you can align using `float:` right or left. you can center an image by using `display: block`. you can set a background image by using `background-image: url("images/pattern.gif")`, this is done in css and it affects whichever element or tag you set it to.
