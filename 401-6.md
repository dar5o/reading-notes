# Reading notes for class 6 of 401

## Authentication 

##### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.

##### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

Add a constructor to a class. Within the constructor, check and see if an instance has already been created. If there's not an instance, create one. Return that instance using a get instance method.

## Vocab

> Router Middleware
  * Router middleware works the same as application middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router()

> Dynamic Module Loading
  * Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

> Singleton Pattern
  * A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance

> CRUD -> REST Method Matches
  * DELETE / delete
  * UPDATE / put
  * READ/ get
  * CREATE / post

> Mock Testing
  * Creating a fake version of an external or internal service that can stand in for the real one, helping your tests run more quickly and more reliably.
