# Reading notes for class 28 of 401

## Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

##### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
Because we can use a React Router to connect all the other components to one App.js file

##### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Inside `<BrowserRouter/>`, outside a `<Route/>`.

##### What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
Unmounts the component

##### What does props.children contain?
It is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component

##### How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
- `useState()` is used for functional components. It is a react hook and does not require the creation of a class
- `this.setState()` is used to handle/change state within a react class component.

## Vocab

> State Hook 
* A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features.

> Mounting and Un-mounting
* The mount command mounts a storage device or filesystem, making it accessible and attaching it to an existing directory structure. The umount command "unmounts" a mounted filesystem, informing the system to complete any pending read or write operations, and safely detaching it
