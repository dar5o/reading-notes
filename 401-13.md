# Reading notes for class 13 of 401

##### What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time.

##### Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
Socket.io, and WebSockets in general, require an http server for the initial upgrade handshake.

##### What happens when a client emits an event?
Events get passed to the server through a websocket

##### What happens when a server emits an event?
Events get passed to the client through a websocket

##### What happens if a client “misses” an event?
Packets are dropped resulting in loss of data

##### How can we mitigate this?
Dropping sockets

## Vocab

> Socket
* a software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network

> Web Socket
* a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection

> Socket.io
* node.js realtime framework server

> Client
* a desktop computer or workstation that is capable of obtaining information and applications from a server

> Server
* a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices

> OSI Model
* The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology

> TCP Model
* The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer.

> TCP
* Transmission Control Protocol

> UDP
* a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet

> Packets
* a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them
