##### Describe “The Cloud”
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

##### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies. 

##### What is auto-scaling?
Auto-scaling is a way to automatically scale up or down the number of compute resources that are being allocated to your application based on its needs at any given time.

##### What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.

##### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.
