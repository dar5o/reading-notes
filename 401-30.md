## Hash Tables

##### Hashing

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.

##### Hash Table

In computing, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
