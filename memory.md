> understanding the javascript call stack

a call is when you execute a method or function, its like calling the function which delays certain lines of code from running, depending on the order you called it in

you can only do one call at a time

LIFO is last in, first out

a stack overflow is when a function recursively calls itself without an exit condition or not being able to hit an exit condition
