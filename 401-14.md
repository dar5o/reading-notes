## Event Driven Architecture

##### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing and ensure that the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved.

##### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
Send a response back to the client once a request has been recieved.

##### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
A message system can be best represented by event driven programming. Emitting a message and responding accordingly.

##### How do you test an event driven system?
1. Ensure supporting topics exist
2. Start the application under test
3. Send some input events
4. Wait until the application has finished processing the test input
5. Assert that it looks right
