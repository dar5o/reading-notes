## Reading notes for class 1, react and components.

> Component-based-architecture

It provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions. It is meant to represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties.
Component based architecture allows for component reusability. 

Component-oriented software design has many advantages over the traditional object-oriented approaches such as 
+ Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
+ Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

Components are well defined sets of functionality that can be protable, modular, or replaceable. A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.
More advantages :
- **Ease of deployment**
 As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- **Reduced cost**
 The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- **Ease of development**
 Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- **Reusable**
 The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- **Modification of technical complexity** 
 A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- **Reliability**
  The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- **System maintenance and evolution** 
Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- **Independent** 
 Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

> Props

If components need to communicate (send data to each other), the way to pass data between components is by using **props**.
“Props” is a special keyword in React and it stands for properties.
They are passed in uni-directional flow (One way from parent to child).


## Things i want to learn more
*how do components interact with the code* 
*is it just the code itself or do components operate outside of the functions*
