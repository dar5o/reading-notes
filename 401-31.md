## Context API

##### Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

##### Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
Unique hooks require it because it checks for violations of the hook rules.

##### What do custom hooks usually do?
Custom hooks are normal JS functions, named with the prefix 'use', that can use hooks inside of it and contain a common stateful logic to be reused in other components


##### Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
useSelectableList, this is a hook that will select a single value from a list of values. 

##### Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
Put the fetchData function above in the useEffect hook and call it, like so: 
```javascript
useEffect(() => { 
const url = "https://api.randominfo.com/api"; 
const fetchData = async () => { 
try { 
const response = await fetch(url); 
const json = await response.json(); 
console.log(json); 
} catch (error) { 
console.log("error", error);
}
};
```

## Vocab

> reducer
* a function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state. the action describes what happened and it is the reducer's job to return the new state based on that action.
