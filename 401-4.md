# Reading notes for class 4 of 401

## Data Modeling

##### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- Only need to write code thats necessary for the test
- Leads to improved design qualities in code
- Better cohesion of code

##### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
Using beforeEach will setup the tests as they are listed in the describe by creating a new structure, while afterEach tears it down cleanly.

##### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
Tests must be maintained when requirements change.

##### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
ES6 classes allow us to instantiate objects; provide a template for creating objects, while constructors focus on how the objects are instantiated.

##### Why REST?
Easier and more approachable than SOAP. Makes your app scalable and easily modifiable

## Vocab

> Functional Programming
  * Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

> Object-Oriented Programming
  * Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

> Class
  * A template for creating objects. 

> super
  * Javascript keyword able to call functions on an objects parent.

> this
  * Javascript keyword referring to an object it belongs to.

> Test Driven Development
  * Validates code before software is fully developed.

> Jest
  * JavaScript testing framework.

> Continuous Integration
  * Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

> REST
  * Representational state transfer (REST) defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave.

> Data Model
  * Abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
