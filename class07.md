>Tables
A table represents information on a grid format, grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes. each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell.

tables are written out using the `<table>` element. the contents of the table are written out row by row.
`<tr>` indicates the start of each row and each cell of a table is represented using a `<td>` element. `<th>` is a table heading and it represents the heading of either a column or a row. 
*you can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.*
*for long tables you can split the table into a `<thead> , <tbody>, and <tfoot>`.*
