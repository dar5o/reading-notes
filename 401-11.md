# Reading notes for class 11 of 401

## Event Driven Applications

##### Why is access control important?
Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

##### Describe an application that would need access control.
Any app that requires an admin login to access data.

##### What is a role used for?
To determine the access they are allowed to have.

##### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
Only needs to check for one value when finding out wether you have access or not.
